python-mailgun2
===============

A super simple Python API for interacting with [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/).
Currently only supports sending messages. Powered by
[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

Python 3 support should be there but is currently untested.

Usage:

```python
from mailgun2 import Mailgun
mailer = Mailgun('apikey', 'example.mailgun.org')
mailer.send_message(
    'from@yourdomain.com',
    ['to@you.com', 'others@you.com'],
    subject='Hi!',
    text='Sweet.'
    )
```

Optional arguments:

```
subject: string subject of the email
text: string body of the email. Either text or html is required.
html: string HTML of the email. Either text or html is required.
cc: list of cc addresses.
bcc: list of bcc addresses.
tags: list of mailgun tags to associate with the email.
```

Coming soon: attachments, inlines, and all the fancy Mailgun features.

Pull requests welcome!
